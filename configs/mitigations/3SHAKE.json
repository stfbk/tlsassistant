    "Name": "3SHAKE",
    "ExtendedName": "Triple Handshake Attack",
    "CVE": "Library dependent",
    "CVSS3": "Library dependent",
    "Description": "Due to the incorrect handling of the session identifier, an attacker is able to force two sessions to have the same <code>Master Secret</code> and ID. The attacker performs 3SHAKE by providing a server to which the victim deliberately connects. Once connected, the malicious server exploits the renegotiation mechanism to manipulate the session.<br/>The attack leads to a client impersonation that, by breaking both confidentiality and authentication, has a serious impact on the transmission.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "The only acceptable mitigation is to use the <code>extended_master_secret</code> TLS extension. For this reason it is recommended to update the TLS library to a version that supports the aforementioned extension (e.g. OpenSSL v1.1.0+).",
