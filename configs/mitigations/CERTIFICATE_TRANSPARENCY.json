    "Description": "With the current configuration, if a CA misissues a valid certificate for this domain, it may take months before being detected. Certificate transparency helps by reducing the interval between detection and mitigation.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Use one of the following SCT delivery methods:\n1. use a CA that embeds the SCT within the certificate;\n2. embed it within a stapled OCSP response;\n3. delivery it using a TLS Extension.\n.",

        "apache": "1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);\n2. add the following lines: \n    - SSLUseStapling on\n    - SSLStaplingResponderTimeout 5\n    - SSLStaplingReturnResponderErrors off\n    - SSLStaplingCache shmcb:/var/run/ocsp(128000)\n\nN.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart` and make sure that your certificate has been logged (check at [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) ).",
