      "ExtendedName": "Crypto Ecb Cipher",
      "Description": "By using block ciphers in ECB mode, the encrypted data can be easily read by a malicious actor even without knowing the decryption key.",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "Use a different encryption mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with a secure initialization vector (IV).<br/> Further information at this links [<a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher.html'>1</a>]",
        "Suggested Steps": "1. Open an IDE (e.g., Android Studio);<br/>2. Search for the 'ECB' mode in the 'Cipher.getInstance()' method;<br/>3. Replace all the vulnerable code with 'CBC' or 'GCM' mode instead of 'ECB';<br/>4. For example from <code>Cipher.getInstance('AES_128/ECB/PKCS5Padding')</code> to <code>Cipher.getInstance('AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding')."
