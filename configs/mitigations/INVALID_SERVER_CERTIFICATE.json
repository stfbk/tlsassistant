      "Description": "This app does not check the validation of X.509 certificates. This represents a critical vulnerability, enabling attackers to carry out Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks undetected.",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "Avoid attempting to override checkClientTrusted, checkServerTrusted, and getAcceptedIssuers methods with empty implementations. <br/> It's recommended to stick with the <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager'>existing API</a> instead of coming up with your own X509Certificate class. You can find further information <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/8?topic=interface-creating-x509trustmanager'>here</a>."
