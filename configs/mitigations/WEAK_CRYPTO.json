      "Description": "By using weak ciphers, the encrypted data can be easily read by a malicious actor even without knowing the decryption key.",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "The only acceptable mitigation is to use more safe and strong encryption algorithms, based on AES.<br/>This vulnerability can give false positives regarding the 3des cipher if it is used to authenticate eletronic cards (e.g. CIE)",
        "Suggested Steps": "1. Open an IDE (e.g., Xcode);<br/>2. Search for the type of encryption algorithms of the CommonCrypto library in the code;<br/>3. Replace the encryption algorithms so that they all use AES;<br/>4. For example from 'kCCAlgorithmDES' to 'kCCAlgorithmAES'."
